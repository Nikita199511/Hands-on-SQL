# Hands-on-SQL

Herein we will deal with what can be said as the core of SQL, where we went from understanding Relational Databases to actually running queries on the created database.
So the range of functions and concepts we dealt with in the project:
Relational Databases and Database Management System, create, insert, select, where, group by, order by, join, inner join, left, full, right join,Nested queries

There is much more scope for the expansion of the project, wherein we can include advanced sql queries for Triggers, delimmitters, window and case functions.
